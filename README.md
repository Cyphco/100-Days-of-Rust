# 100 Days of Rust ðŸ¦€

A personal journey of learning Rust programming language through daily coding challenges and projects.

## About This Project

This repository documents my 100-day journey of learning Rust, starting from January 2025. Each day, I tackle new concepts, challenges, and mini-projects to improve my understanding of Rust's unique features and programming paradigms.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized by weeks and days:

```
Week-01/
  â”œâ”€â”€ Day-01_Convert-Ages-To-Days/
  â”œâ”€â”€ Day-02_[Project]/
  â””â”€â”€ ...
Week-02/
  â”œâ”€â”€ Day-08_[Project]/
  â””â”€â”€ ...
...
```

Each day's folder contains:
- Source code for the daily challenge/project
- Documentation of concepts learned
- Tests (where applicable)

## Goals

- Master Rust's ownership and borrowing system
- Understand memory safety without garbage collection
- Learn concurrent programming with Rust
- Build practical applications using Rust
- Explore Rust's ecosystem and popular crates


## Running the Projects

Each project can be run using Cargo, Rust's package manager:

```bash
cd [project-directory]
cargo run
```

To run tests:
```bash
cargo test
```
